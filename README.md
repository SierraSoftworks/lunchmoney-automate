# Lunch Money Automation
This repository includes an Azure Function which will automate certain general cleanup
tasks on your Lunch Money account. These include grouping transactions between accounts
automatically and associating spare change transactions with the original purchase.

If you're like me, these transactions make up 80%+ of your monthly transaction count
and being able to condense them into something vaguely readable is an absolute game
changer.
